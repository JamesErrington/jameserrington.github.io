### About me
<div class="main__hero">

	I'm James, a software engineer from the UK. I have previously worked on web and full stack application development for small and large companies, including in finance. I am currently interested in expanding my knowledge of lower level languages, as well as the internals of systems like databases and compilers.

I studied both undergraduate and masters degrees in Computer Science at the University of Southampton, graduating in 2020. I have also worked on smaller side projects, and enjoy hacking about in various programming languages exploring what I can do.

Outside of programming I am a keen orienteer and world traveller, a scout leader, and a fan of cricket and football.
